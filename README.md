# WAT (WindowsActivationTool)
Welcome to the official page of WAT (short for WindowsActivationTool), the free, open-source, Windows activation tool! This program allows the activation of the Windows operating system using GVLK (short for General Volume License Keys), slmgr.vbs (an activation script Windows disponibilizes) and a KMS (short for Key Management Services) server.

# Why I have created this program
Since Microsoft has decided to be greedy and make Windows a paid operating system, I have sought out to create a free activator, that not only fights Microsoft's greedy practices, but also create competition to closed source activators, like KMS Pico.

Eventually, in July of 2023, the very first version of the program, WindowsActivationTool, is launched on the internet, with version 1.1 coming out a month later.

The most recent version, 1.2, was released in May of 2024, bringing the biggest revamp seen so far.

# Version 1
WAT 1 was what brought the program to life. It could activate Windows 7 to Windows 11. With only 14,5 KB, this is the most lightweight actiavtion program.

# Version 1.2
WAT 1.2 brought a revamp to the app. From an easier to comprehend GUI to a even more helpful help section, this version is the most revolutionary version I've ever released.
